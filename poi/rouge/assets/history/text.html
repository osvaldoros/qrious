<p><h3>History of the Beare</h3><br> <br>The nearby Beare Landfill (which is just west of the wetland) was operational between 1965 and 1985, and received 10 million tonnes of garbage from Toronto citizens and businesses. Soil and sand was removed, on a daily basis, from the Beare Borrow Pit to cover the garbage. After the landfill was closed the Borrow Pit remained sparsely vegetated because the topsoil had been removed leaving a grey impermeable subsoil.<br> <br>In 1998 the Friends of the Rouge began working with the City of Toronto to restore areas around the Borrow Pit. Reforestation was successful where topsoil remained, but the Pit area had little topsoil and poor drainage.<br><br>FRW began to explore wetland restoration, and built a number of small trial ponds. These ponds retained water and attracted frogs, turtles, birds and dragonflies. Pleased with this success, the City of Toronto, the Toronto Zoo, as well as other government and business partners - and thousands of volunteers - worked together with the Friends of the Rouge to restore ponds, wetlands and meadows in the entire five hectare site.<br><br>Subsoil was formed into wide berms (dams) to raise water levels and create additional wetland areas. Buried pipes regulate water levels and allow slow drainage. The ponds vary in size, shape, depth and shoreline to increase habitat diversity. Logs, branches, sand, rocks and peninsulas increase shoreline habitat niches and shelter from predators.<br><br>Today the Beare Wetland is home to more than 100 native tree, shrub and wildflower species. This vegetation attracts many types of butterflies and moths including monarch, viceroy, checkerspot, swallowtail, cecropia and polythemus. Various mammals also use the site, including mink, otter, deer, beaver, fox, coyote, turtles (including Blandings turtles, a species at risk), newts, frogs, toads and snakes.<br><br><br>(source: Friends of the Rouge Newsletter, Vol. 1, Number 1)</p>
