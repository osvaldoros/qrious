<p><h3>Staghorn Sumac</h3><i>(Rhustyphina)</i><br> <br>Staghorn sumac is found primarily in Southeastern Canada and the Northeastern United States. It grows well in a variety of conditions, including soils where other plants are unable to grow.<br> <br>This shrub is an important plant to First Nations people - the fruit contains vitamin C, the leaves and berries can be used as an ink or dye (and were also smoked along with tobacco). Staghorn sumac is also an important food source for many birds and animals - including pheasant, grouse, deer, rabbits, robins and starlings - especially because the fruit will often last throughout the winter when other food sources can be scarce.<br> <br>The leaves turn their distinctive and brilliant red colour in the fall.
