<p><h3>White Pine</h3><i>(pinusstrobus)</i><br> <br>Often growing for more than 450 years and reaching heights of 50 meters (164 ft), the white pine is the tallest tree in eastern North America. During the colonial period, agents of the British Crown marked the tallest and straightest white pines with a special symbol reserving them for the use of the British Royal Navy.<br> <br>The white pine is one of the most valuable tree species in North America as the wood is widely used in construction and cabinet making. White pine is also very important ecologically: <br> <br>-squirrels, mice and chipmunks eat the seeds and needles
<br>-rabbits feed on the bark
<br>-blackbears sometimes hibernate in dead or dying trees
<br>-bald eagles, lynx, flying squirrels, woodpeckers and other creatures use the white pine for nesting, shelter or protection from predators
<br><br>White pine needles contain more than five times the vitamin C of lemons (by weight) and provide one the easiest ways to identify the tree from other pine species - it's needles grow in bunches of five.<br><br><br>(sources: Wikipedia, Trent University)</p>
